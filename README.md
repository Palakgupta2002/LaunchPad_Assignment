# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack task management application developed as part of an assignment by the Launchpad organization. It consists of two main dashboards: one for users and another for admins.

## User Dashboard Features

- **Task Editing**: Users can edit various aspects of their tasks, including priority, due dates, and titles.
- **Task Completion**: Users can update the completion status of their tasks.
- **Task Management**: Users have the ability to manage their tasks efficiently.

## Admin Dashboard Features

- **User Management**: Admins can perform operations related to user management, such as deletion and viewing user details.
- **Task Management**: Admins have full control over tasks, including adding, deleting, and updating them.
- **Task Filtering**: Admins can filter tasks based on different criteria.
- **Task Sorting**: Admins can sort tasks based on various parameters.
- **Task Searching**: Admins can search for specific tasks using keywords.

## Additional Functionality

- **Authentication**: The application likely includes authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to user and admin dashboards.
- **Database Integration**: It utilizes a database to store user information, task details, and other relevant data.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

By incorporating these features and functionalities, the project aims to provide users and admins with a comprehensive task management solution.
